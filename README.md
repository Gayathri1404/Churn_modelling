# Churn_modelling
# 📊 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical problem for subscription-based businesses. This project aims to analyze customer behavior and predict churn using machine learning models, enabling proactive customer retention strategies.

# 🚀 Features
End-to-end machine learning pipeline:
* Data Preprocessing
* Feature Engineering
* Model Training & Evaluation
* Best Model Selection

# Comparison of three models:
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Classifier
* Gradient Boosting Classifier

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Joblib

# 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about customer demographics, geography, account balance, and other features that influence churn.

# How to Run the Project
1. Clone the Repository
git clone git clone https://github.com/Gayathri1404/Churn_modelling.git
cd Churn_modelling

2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Script
python churn_modelling.py

# 📈 Results
Achieved high accuracy using the Gradient Boosting Classifier.
The best model has been saved as best_churn_model.pkl for deployment purposes.

# 📌 Key Insights
Preprocessing features like geography and gender improved model accuracy significantly.
Gradient Boosting outperformed Logistic Regression and Random Forest on key metrics like precision and recall.

# 🎯 Future Enhancements
Integrating the model into a web app for real-time predictions.
Adding advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning and deep learning.
